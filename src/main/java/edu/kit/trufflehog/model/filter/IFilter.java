/**
 * <p>
 *     The IFilter interface defines the basic functionality of a filter. A filter is something that checks whether an
 *     {@link INode} matches certain criteria that are defined in the filter (ex. blacklist/whitelist based on IPs). If
 *     a node matches a filter, the filter updates the node's {@link NodeRenderer} where information is kept
 *     about how that node should be displayed by the view. So for example, if a node happens to be on a blacklist, then
 *     the color of the node could be set to red in the NodeRenderer, and the node will be drawn red on the view
 *     to indicate it is part of the blacklist.
 * </p>
