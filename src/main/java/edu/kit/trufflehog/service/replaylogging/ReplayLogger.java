 * <p>
 *     The ReplayLogger manages the saving of the graph structure. It creates {@link ReplayLog} objects which are serialized
 *     and saved. From these ReplayLog objects, the entire graph can be recreated from a certain point in time.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     The ReplayLogger saves the state of the graph through two things. It takes snapshots of the graph every X seconds
 *     through the {@link SnapshotLogger} and then saves all commands that occurred from that point on until the next
 *     snapshot is taken through the {@link CommandLogger}. Together these snapshots with the list of commands form a
 *     ReplayLog. When blocks of DataLogs that were saved consecutively are loaded back into memory, they can be used to
 *     reconstruct the graph by taking the snapshot as the original graph and then applying all commands that occurred
 *     back on the graph, in the order and interval they occurred. This is how old graphs can be viewed.
