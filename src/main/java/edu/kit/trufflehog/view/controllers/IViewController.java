 *     {@code IViewControllers} always provide a specified range of
 *     interactions that can be invoked. By using this abstraction a view
 *     controller only needs to know the interactions it can perform, and
 *     does not have any idea of the underlying commands that are mapped to
 *     these interactions by the
 *     {@link edu.kit.trufflehog.presenter.Presenter}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     Every IViewController is also integrated into the notification
 *     framework of this application by implementing the
 *     {@link INotifier} interface. Meaning if
 *     interactions are invoked on a view controller, the commands mapped to
 *     these interactions are sent to all listeners.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <I> The type of interactions this view controller can invoke.
 *           Typically implemented by a specific enumeration.
