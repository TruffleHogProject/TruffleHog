 *     The MacroFilter is the class that should be used when working with filters. You can add new filters
 *     through it or check nodes against existing filters. It contains a list of all active nodes, and when a new node
 *     is created, it is checked against all filters contained in the MacroFilter.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     When a filter is found that matches a certain node, the corresponding {@link NodeRenderer} is updated,
 *     where information about how the node should be displayed is kept. The view then renders the node according to its
 *     NodeRenderer.
